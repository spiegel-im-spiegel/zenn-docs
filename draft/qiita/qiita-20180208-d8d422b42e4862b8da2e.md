Go 1.8.7, 1.9.4, 1.10rc2 がリリースされた。脆弱性 [CVE-2018-6574](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-6574) の修正を含む。

- [cmd/go: arbitrary code execution during “go get” · Issue #23672 · golang/go](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23672)

cgo 周りのインシデントのようだ。

> When cgo is enabled, the build step during “go get” invokes the host C compiler, gcc or clang, adding compiler flags specified in the Go source files. Both gcc and clang support a plugin mechanism in which a shared-library plugin is loaded into the compiler, as directed by compiler flags. This means that a Go package repository can contain an attack.so file along with a Go source file that says (for example) `// #cgo CFLAGS: -fplugin=attack.so`, causing the attack plugin to be loaded into the host C compiler during the build. Gcc and clang plugins are completely unrestricted in their access to the host system.

修正内容は以下の通り。

> The fix changes “go build” (used during “go get” and “go install”) to limit the flags that can appear in Go source file `#cgo` directives to a list of allowed compiler flags; `-fplugin=` and other variants are not on the allowed list. The same restrictions are applied to compiler flags obtained from pkg-config. Flags obtained from the environment variables `$CGO_CFLAGS` and so on are not restricted, since those variables can only be set by the user running the build. To change the set of allowed compiler flags, new environment variables `$CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW` and `$CGO_CFLAGS_DISALLOW` can set to regular expressions matching additional allowed and disallowed flags.

影響度（CVSS）に関する情報は見当たらない。そのうち [Red Hat あたり](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/ "Red Hat Product Advisories - Red Hat Customer Portal")で出るかな。
